## Admin Dashboard Setup Instructions

The HandyWriterz platform includes a powerful admin dashboard for managing content across all service pages. This guide will help you set up and use the admin dashboard.

### Setup Process

1. **Database Setup**

   The admin dashboard requires specific database tables. You can set these up by running our script:

   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

3. **Start the Application**

   Start the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The admin dashboard will be available at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/admin
   ```
